# Train Journey View using OpenGL

## Overview

The **Train Journey View** project is a simulation created using OpenGL, designed to showcase a train journey in a graphical 3D environment. This project demonstrates the use of computer graphics techniques to render realistic scenes, objects, and animations, making it an ideal learning tool for OpenGL enthusiasts and developers.

## Features

- **3D Environment Simulation**: Realistic rendering of a train journey with dynamic objects and landscapes.
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can interact with the simulation to adjust the view or navigate the scene.
- **Lighting and Texturing**: Includes realistic lighting and textures for enhanced visual appeal.
- **Animation**: Simulates train movement and other dynamic elements in the environment.
- **Scenic Elements**: Features surroundings like trees, tracks, and stations to enrich the experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Graphics Library**: OpenGL

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio).
- OpenGL libraries installed.
- A compatible system with support for OpenGL.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shishir786/Train-journy-view-using-open_gl-.git
   cd Train-journy-view-using-open_gl-
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure OpenGL libraries and development tools are installed on your system.

   **On Ubuntu/Debian:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install build-essential freeglut3-dev libglew-dev
   ```

   **On Windows:**
   Install OpenGL libraries via an IDE like Visual Studio or Code::Blocks.

   **On macOS:**

   ```bash
   brew install glew glfw
   ```

3. **Compile the Project**
   Use a C++ compiler to compile the source files. For example:

   ```bash
   g++ -o train_journey main.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   ./train_journey
   ```

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application:** Start the executable to view the train journey simulation.
2. **Interactive Features:** Use keyboard and mouse controls to navigate the scene or adjust the view.
3. **Exit:** Close the application by exiting the simulation window.

## Future Enhancements

- **Expand Scenery:** Add more elements like rivers, bridges, or tunnels.
- **Enhanced Interaction:** Implement camera controls or additional user inputs.
- **Optimization:** Improve rendering performance for larger environments.
